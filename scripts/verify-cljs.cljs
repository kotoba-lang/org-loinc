;; Not a formality. `loinc.check-digit`/`loinc.code` map ASCII digit
;; characters to their numeric value, and `loinc.release-csv` builds
;; strings character-by-character while scanning a CSV -- both are
;; exactly the kind of "character -> code point" code that silently
;; returns zeros under ClojureScript's `int` instead of throwing (see
;; `dicom.bytes/char-code`'s docstring in this workspace's
;; `org-dicomstandard-dicom` for the mechanism, and this library's own
;; README for where it was caught here).
