(ns loinc.release-csv
  "A parser for the **column layout** of LOINC's published release
  files (`Loinc.csv` in the official release ZIP) — RFC 4180-shaped CSV,
  header-driven, so a licensee who has downloaded their own copy of the
  release from loinc.org can load it into data this library's other
  namespaces (`loinc.parts`, `loinc.code`) can work with.

  **This module ships no LOINC content whatsoever** — no header list,
  no column count, no code, no term. It is deliberately *header-driven*
  rather than hardcoded to a specific schema, for two reasons: (1) the
  exact column set has grown across LOINC release versions (new columns
  are added; nothing is guaranteed about which of dozens of columns a
  given release has), and this library has no way to verify a hardcoded
  list against a real release file without downloading licensed content,
  which it will not do; (2) a parser that reads *whatever header row is
  actually present* works correctly against any release version a
  licensee supplies, rather than silently mis-columning against a
  version this library's author never saw.

  Input is a plain string (the CSV file's own text, already read by the
  caller) — this namespace does no file/network IO of its own, per the
  library-wide no-IO rule."

;; --- RFC 4180 field-level parsing ----------------------------------------
;;
;; A hand-rolled state machine rather than `clojure.string/split`, because
;; `split` on `,` breaks the moment any field is quoted and contains a
;; literal comma or embedded newline — both of which are legal, and both
;; of which appear in real LOINC release files (LONG_COMMON_NAME and
;; several other free-text columns routinely contain commas).

;; `field` accumulates as a vector of chars, joined with `apply str` only
;; once the field is complete — not a `java.lang.StringBuilder` (JVM-only,
;; no ClojureScript equivalent) and not repeated `str` concatenation
;; (quadratic). `(nth s i)` / `count` on a string work identically on
;; both runtimes for reading.

  reordered, so field names in the caller's data always match the
  release file's own column names exactly). A row with a different
  field count than the header is reported per-row as `[:error
  :loinc/row-field-count-mismatch]` rather than silently
  zipped/truncated. Returns `[:error :loinc/empty-csv]` for `rows`
