  "LOINC's six-axis part model — a data *shape*, not data. Every LOINC
  term is fully specified by six independent axes (this decomposition,
  and the colon-delimited \"Fully-Specified Name\" convention that
  concatenates them, is LOINC's published structural model — see LOINC's
  freely-available Users' Guide chapter on the six-part naming
  convention — not the licensed code-to-name table itself):

  | axis | question it answers | example axis *value* (illustrative only, not a real term) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Component | what is measured/observed | `Sodium` |
  | Property  | the kind of property (e.g. mass concentration) | `SCnc` |
  | Time      | single point vs. time interval | `Pt` |
  | System    | the specimen/system observed | `Ser/Plas` |
  | Scale     | how the result is expressed (quantitative/ordinal/nominal/narrative) | `Qn` |
  | Method    | how the observation was made, when relevant | (often empty) |

  This namespace provides the *shape* (a plain map with these six keys),
  a validator that the shape has all six keys present (possibly blank —
  `Method` legitimately is, for many terms), and the Fully-Specified Name
  concatenation/parsing convention. It does not ship, and has no way to
  look up, any actual axis values for any actual LOINC code — a licensee
  supplies those from their own copy of the release file (see
  `loinc.release-csv`)."

  library does not attempt to disambiguate an FSN whose Component text
